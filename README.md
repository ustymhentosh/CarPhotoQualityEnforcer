# ðŸš— Car Photo Quality Enforcer
A tool designed to automatically assess and improve car listing photos to ensure they meet quality standards for marketplaces and classified listings.

## Overview
This app helps users verify whether their car photo meets a range of criteria that are typically expected for professional or marketplace listings. It evaluates:

- Presence of a car

- Photo angle

- Exposure (overexposed / underexposed)

- Car positioning

- Image resolution

The project was developed by Ustym Hentosh and Lev Kupybida.

## Data
Training data was scraped from online car marketplaces, such as auto.ria.com, across various categories and manufacturing years:

**Body Types:** Sedan, SUV/Crossover, MiniVan, Hatchback, Pickup<br>
**Side Types:** profile-on-right, profile-on-left, front, back, angle-front-on-right,  angle-front-on-left,  angle-back-on-right, angle-back-on-left

Year Ranges: 2000â€“2005, 2005â€“2010, ..., up to 2020â€“2025

- ~500 photos per body type â†’ ~2200 photos total
- ~200 from different sides â†’ ~1600 photos total

Data scraping was done via BeautifulSoup.

## Architecture
The app is implemented using Streamlit for the frontend and runs multiple deep learning models in the backend to evaluate different aspects of the uploaded image.

App Flow
Upload Photo

Run tests:

âœ… Car or not (binary classifier)

âœ… Photo angle (multi-class classifier)

âœ… Exposure test (two binary classifiers: overexposed / underexposed)

âœ… Car cropping (YOLO-based detection)

âœ… Positioning check (crop quality and gray border if needed)

âœ… Quality check (image resolution)

Model Components
| Task                 | Model                | Type            | Path                          |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Car detection        | `CarOrNot`           | CNN (2 classes) | `car_or_not_detection_v0.pth` |
| Angle classification | `CarSide`            | CNN (8 classes) | `side_detection_v0.pth`       |
| Overexposure check   | `OverexposedOrNot`   | Binary CNN      | `overexposed_model.pth`       |
| Underexposure check  | `OveredarkenedOrNot` | Binary CNN      | `overdarkened_model.pth`      |
| Car positioning      | `CarChopper`         | YOLOv8          | `yolov8n.pt`                  |
| Smart crop tool      | `Croper`             | Heuristic/YOLO  | Custom code                   |


All models are loaded once and cached using @st.cache_resource.

## Image Evaluation Criteria
Each photo is tested across five dimensions:

- Is it a car?

- From which angle was the photo taken? (ideal: front or angle-front)

- Is the exposure good?

- Is the car centered and within acceptable margins?

- Is the resolution high enough? (â‰¥1800x1200 recommended)

Based on these checks, the user gets visual and textual feedback, including a preview of the final cropped or padded image.
